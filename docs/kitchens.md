# Kitchens
Each floor has another kitchen culture. Please ask you neighbors which dishes you can use etc.
Please also keep in mind to keep the surfaces in the kitchen clean and wash your dishes

## Garbage
Every day in the morning (mo-fr) a cleaning company collects the garbage from each kitchen and bathroom. Please keep in mind that they do not collect private garbage. This you have to take yourself to the containers located in the inner court. There you can find different containers.

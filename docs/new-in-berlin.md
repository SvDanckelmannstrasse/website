# Registration at the 'Bürgeramt'

Everyone who lives in Germany must be registered at the record section. Within 14 days after moving in you must attend one of Berlin's city halls to register yourself.
There are two exceptions when you do not have to register yourself:
* You're a visitor in Berlin and you stay at max 2 months
* You've already registered yourself with another appartment in Germany and you stay in Berlin at max 6 months

## How to register yourself?
1. Arrange an appointment at the Bürgeramt. You can do this online on [Terminvereinbarung](https://service.berlin.de/terminvereinbarung/termin/tag.php?termin=1&anliegen[]=120686&dienstleisterlist=122210,122217,122219,122227,122231,122243,122252,122260,122262,122254,122271,122273,122277,122280,122282,122284,122291,122285,122286,122296,327262,325657,150230,122301,122297,122294,122312,122314,122304,122311,122309,317869,324433,325341,324434,122281,324414,122283,122279,122276,122274,122267,122246,122251,122257,122208,122226&herkunft=http%3A%2F%2Fservice.berlin.de%2Fdienstleistung%2F120686%2F)

# Insurances

Is this your first appartment in Germany? Then you have probably never taken out any insurance in Germany as well. Generally it is recommended to get a household and idemnity insurance. These two are often sold as a combined package. We advise you to compare different offers and choose the one which best suits your needs.
We advise you to ensure that you have health insurance, please contact your insurance company if you have any concerns.


# Your new address

Institutions like banks, insurance companies and the university need to know your current address. You have to inform them about your change of address, normally there are special forms for this procedure. Because mail often gets mixed up here it is highly recommended to communicate your WEN (apartment number) as well. You can easily find this number just above your apartment door or in your rental contract (the last three digits are sufficient!).

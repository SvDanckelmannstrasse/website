# Tutor
Beside the SV the dorm has also a [tutor](https://www.stw.berlin/international/themen/wht-danckelmannstra%C3%9Fe.html). While the SV has more administrative tasks the tutor is the first contact person when you have problems or questions (e.g. concerning visa, the dorm life etc.).
You can contact him or her by calling 0151 16 60 02 77

# Washing machines - Time to wash?
The washing machines and the dryer are located in the basement and you can access it through the inner court.

There are five washing machines and one dryer. The cost per wash is 2€ and per drying cycle is 1€. The payment is done by your charged washing card (you can charge it in the SV office hours ).
But how do I get a washing card?
For a deposit of 15€ you will get a washing card that you can charge at the SV office hours and use it to turn on the washing machines and dryer.

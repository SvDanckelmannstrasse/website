# Floors
The dorm has four floors and each floor is separated into four sections. Each section has a specific color (red, yellow, green, blue).
The elevator is in the red section and from there you can reach any section by using your main key. Of course you can also use the stairs :D There are two staircases in the building, one beside the entrance and the other in the back of the building next to the elevator.

# [closed due to corona] Gym - Or at least this is how we call it...
Do you feel like having those six packs but it is too cold outside to go to the gym? Do you want to go for a run but you just ordered pizza? Don't worry.
The gym is located next to the SV office on the right hand side of the main entrance. You need a special key to enter it which you can get in the SV office hour for a deposit of 50â‚¬ that you get back once you bring back the key. The gym can be used 24/7.

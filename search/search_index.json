We organize events, mediate between residents whenever conflict arise, communicate with representatives of the 'Studierendenwerk', administer the SV's finance, provide group facilites like the common room, the bar and the lavatory. Each year we hold a general meeting with the dorm's residents to elect the new board for the SV team. This is when we present our past work and the responsibilites and rights of every post to the audience. Please come and vote, even if you are not keen to run for a post Without a minimum attendance there will be no election outcome and no new SV-board which means that we will have to shut down the lavatory, the common room and the bar. How to contact the SV? Our office hour is Wednesday 9-10pm. Our room is located on the right side after entering the building from the main entrance. You can send us also an email to svdanckelmannev@gmail.com What can you expect in the SV office hours? Get / Charge your washing card Ask for assistance or find a solution for a problem you're facing Get the gym keys Borrow a vacuum cleaner Borrow a tool box Borrow boarding games, pool and table tennis equipments etc. Floor Money Each section has an amount of 30\u20ac per semester. With this money the residents of each section can buy what their kitchen needs as soap, sponges etc. Or a nice toaster or even arrange a floor breakfast together. How does this work? In order to get your money back you need to bring the receipt to the SV office hour signed by three residents of your section including yourself. Remember the whole amount permitted per semester cannot exceed 30\u20ac. Remember to use the 30\u20ac by the end of the semester (end of March and end of September). Food sharing Food sharing is an amazing platform. After signing up you can get food from restaurants or super markets which would have normally been thrown away which in most cases is a waste.","title":"SV"},{"location":"sv/#student-self-administration-studentische-selbstverwaltung","text":"Many different matters which are taken care of behind the scences, which are organized and taken care of on a voluntary basis by students who are living here as well.
